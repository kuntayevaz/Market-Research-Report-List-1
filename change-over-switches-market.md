<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Change-over Switches Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Automatic</li><li>Manual</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Change-over switches are electrical devices used to switch between power sources in various applications. The market for change-over switches can be categorized into two types: automatic and manual. </p><p>Automatic change-over switches are designed to automatically shift power supply from one source to another when a fault or power outage occurs. This ensures a continuous power supply without any human intervention. They are commonly used in critical applications such as hospitals and data centers.</p><p>On the other hand, manual change-over switches require manual operation to switch between power sources. These switches typically have a lever or knob that needs to be moved by an individual to change the power supply. They are used in applications where power source switching is less frequent and manual control is preferred, such as residential backup generators.</p><p>Both types of change-over switches serve the purpose of maintaining a stable power supply, but their modes of operation differ, with automatic switches requiring no human involvement while manual switches rely on manual intervention.</p></p>
