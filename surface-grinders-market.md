<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surface Grinders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Planer Type Surface Grinder</li><li>Rotary Type Surface Grinders</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Planer Type Surface Grinder: A planer type surface grinder is a type of surface grinder that uses a planer bed rather than a rotary table to hold and move the workpiece. This bed moves in a back-and-forth motion, allowing for the grinding wheel to make accurate and precise cuts along the length of the workpiece.</p><p>Rotary Type Surface Grinder: A rotary type surface grinder is a type of surface grinder that uses a rotary table to hold and rotate the workpiece in order to grind its surface. The rotary table allows for continuous and precise grinding, as the workpiece is constantly rotating and the grinding wheel can be adjusted to achieve the desired results.</p></p>
