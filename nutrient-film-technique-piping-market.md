<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nutrient Film Technique Piping Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Steel</li><li>Plastic</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Nutrient Film Technique (NFT) is a hydroponic system that involves a continual flow of nutrient-rich water running through a shallow tray or trough where the plants' roots are suspended. When it comes to the piping market types, steel and plastic are the most commonly used materials for constructing the NFT system. Steel pipes offer durability and strength, providing stability to the system. On the other hand, plastic pipes are lightweight, cost-effective, and easy to manipulate, making them a more affordable option for smaller-scale NFT setups. Both types have their advantages and are chosen based on specific requirements.</p></p>
