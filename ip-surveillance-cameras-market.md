<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The IP Surveillance Cameras Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centralized IP Surveillance Cameras</li><li>Decentralized IP Surveillance Cameras</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The IP surveillance cameras market is divided into two main types: centralized IP surveillance cameras and decentralized IP surveillance cameras. </p><p>Centralized IP surveillance cameras are connected to a central network video recorder (NVR) or server. They transmit the video footage to the centralized location for storage and management. This type offers high-quality and centralized control over multiple cameras, making it suitable for large-scale surveillance applications. </p><p>Decentralized IP surveillance cameras, on the other hand, have built-in storage and processing capabilities. They can operate independently and do not require a central server. This type provides flexibility and cost efficiency, as each camera can function on its own. It is ideal for smaller-scale surveillance deployments, where simplicity and affordability are prioritized.</p></p>
