<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Animal Functional Proteins Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrolysates</li><li>Concentrates</li><li>Isolates</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The animal functional proteins market can be categorized into three types: hydrolysates, concentrates, and isolates. Hydrolysates are proteins that have been broken down into smaller peptides, making them easier to digest and absorb. Concentrates contain a high level of protein and are derived by removing the non-protein components from the source material. Isolates are the purest form of protein, with all other components removed. These different types of animal functional proteins cater to various applications in the food, beverage, and pharmaceutical industries, offering unique functional and nutritive benefits.</p></p>
