<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intelligent Industrial Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal</li><li>Positive Displacement</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Intelligent Industrial Pump market consists of two main types: Centrifugal and Positive Displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps work by converting rotational energy into fluid flow, utilizing rotating impellers to increase the velocity and pressure of the liquid. On the other hand, Positive Displacement pumps move fluid by trapping a fixed amount of it and then forcing it to move into the discharge pipe. These two types are commonly used in industrial settings to transfer fluids efficiently and intelligently, ensuring smooth operations and optimized performance.</p></p>
