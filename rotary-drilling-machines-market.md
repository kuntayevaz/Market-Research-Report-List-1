<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Drilling Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Normal Circulation</li><li>Reverse Circulation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rotary drilling machines are used for drilling boreholes in various applications. Normal circulation drilling involves the use of drilling mud, which is pumped down the drill string and returns to the surface, carrying the drill cuttings. This method is commonly used in oil and gas exploration. In reverse circulation drilling, the drilling mud is pumped down the annular space between the drill string and drill hole, and then returns to the surface through the drill pipe. This method is often used in mineral exploration, as it facilitates sample retrieval and prevents contamination.</p></p>
