<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The LTE Small Base Station Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Time Division Duplex (TDD)</li><li>Frequency Division Duplex (FDD)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The LTE Small Base Station market consists of two types: Time Division Duplex (TDD) and Frequency Division Duplex (FDD). TDD technology allows for transmission and reception of data on the same frequency but at different time intervals. This benefits operators with symmetrical traffic patterns and flexible spectrum allocation. On the other hand, FDD divides the available frequency spectrum into separate uplink and downlink channels, allowing simultaneous transmission and reception of data. FDD suits operators with high capacity and coverage requirements but lacks spectrum flexibility compared to TDD.</p></p>
