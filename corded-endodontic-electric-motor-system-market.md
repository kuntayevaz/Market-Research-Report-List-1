<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Corded Endodontic Electric Motor System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Without Integrated Apex Locator</li><li>With Integrated Apex Locator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The corded endodontic electric motor system market comprises two types: without integrated apex locator and with integrated apex locator. The without integrated apex locator type does not have a built-in device to accurately determine the position of the root apex during root canal treatment. On the other hand, the with integrated apex locator type is equipped with a built-in apex locator which helps in precisely locating the root apex, improving the effectiveness and accuracy of the root canal procedure. Both types serve the purpose of providing electric motor assistance during endodontic procedures, but with the added advantage of integrated apex locator in the latter.</p></p>
