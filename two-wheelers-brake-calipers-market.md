<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Two Wheelers Brake Calipers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Piston Caliper</li><li>Multi-Piston Caliper</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The two-wheeler brake calipers market consists of two types: single piston caliper and multi-piston caliper. Single piston caliper refers to a brake system that uses only one piston to apply pressure on the brake pads, resulting in a moderate stopping force. On the other hand, multi-piston caliper utilizes multiple pistons to distribute force evenly on the brake pads, generating a higher stopping power. Both types offer different levels of braking performance and are chosen based on the requirements and preferences of riders.</p></p>
