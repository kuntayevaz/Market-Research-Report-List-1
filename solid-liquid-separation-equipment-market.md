<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solid-Liquid Separation Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Peparator</li><li>Screw Press</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solid-liquid separation equipment refers to machines used to separate solid particles from a liquid mixture. Centrifugal separators use centrifugal force to separate the solid particles from the liquid. They work by spinning the mixture at high speeds, causing the solids to move toward the outer edges while the liquid remains in the center. On the other hand, screw presses utilize a rotating screw to squeeze the liquid out of the solid particles, effectively separating them. Both types of equipment are commonly used in various industries for wastewater treatment, mining, and food processing applications.</p></p>
