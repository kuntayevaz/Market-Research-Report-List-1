<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Calcium Alginate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High M Calcium Alginates</li><li>High G Calcium Alginates</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Calcium alginate can be classified into two types: high M calcium alginates and high G calcium alginates. High M calcium alginates have a higher content of mannuronic acid, which leads to a more flexible gel formation and higher stability in acidic conditions. On the other hand, high G calcium alginates have a higher content of guluronic acid, resulting in a more rigid gel formation and better stability in alkaline conditions. These types are chosen based on the specific application requirements, such as wound healing, drug delivery, or food thickening.</p></p>
