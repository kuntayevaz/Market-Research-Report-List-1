<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Near-beer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Limit Fermentation</li><li>Dealcoholization Method</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The near-beer market consists of two main types: limit fermentation and dealcoholization method. In the limit fermentation process, the fermentation of beer is intentionally stopped before all the alcohol is produced, resulting in a low-alcohol content product. On the other hand, the dealcoholization method involves removing the alcohol from a fully fermented beer. This is typically done through various processes such as vacuum distillation or reverse osmosis. Both methods aim to produce near-beer options with reduced alcohol content while still maintaining a similar taste and flavor profile to traditional beers.</p></p>
