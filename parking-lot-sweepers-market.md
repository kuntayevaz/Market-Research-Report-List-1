<p><strong>The Parking Lot Sweepers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Sweepers</li><li>Vacuum Air Sweepers</li><li>Regenerative Air Sweepers</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Parking lot sweepers are used to clean and maintain parking lots and other paved surfaces. There are three main types of parking lot sweepers: mechanical sweepers, vacuum air sweepers, and regenerative air sweepers. Mechanical sweepers utilize spinning brushes to physically remove debris from the pavement. Vacuum air sweepers, on the other hand, use powerful suction to collect dirt and waste. Regenerative air sweepers combine both methods by using brushes to loosen debris and then sucking it up with a strong airflow. Each type has its advantages and suitability for different situations.</p></p>
