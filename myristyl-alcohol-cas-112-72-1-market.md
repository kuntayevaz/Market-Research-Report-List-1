<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Myristyl Alcohol (CAS 112-72-1) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ziegler Process Method</li><li>Hydroformylation Method</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Myristyl Alcohol (CAS 112-72-1) is a fatty alcohol derived from natural sources like coconut oil or animal fats. It is widely used in the production of personal care and cosmetic products due to its emollient properties. In terms of market types, there are two methods for its production: the Ziegler process and the Hydroformylation method. The Ziegler process involves the use of a catalyst to convert butanal to myristaldehyde, which is then hydrogenated to produce myristyl alcohol. On the other hand, the Hydroformylation method involves the reaction of 1-tetradecene with carbon monoxide and hydrogen to yield myristaldehyde, which is also hydrogenated to obtain myristyl alcohol. These methods provide different purity levels and production costs, leading to variations in the market.</p></p>
