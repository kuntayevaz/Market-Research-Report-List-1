<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hard Seal Butterfly Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flangedless</li><li>Flanged</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Hard Seal Butterfly Valves market can be classified into two types: Flangedless and Flanged valves. Flangedless valves are designed without flanges, where the valve body is directly connected to the piping system. This design simplifies installation and reduces the overall size of the valve assembly. On the other hand, Flanged valves have flanges attached to the valve body, allowing easy connection to pipes using bolts and nuts. Flanged valves provide a more secure and leak-proof connection, making them suitable for high-pressure or critical applications.</p></p>
