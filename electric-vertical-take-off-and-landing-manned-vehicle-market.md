<p><strong>The Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing Manned Vehicle Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tilt-X</li><li>Lift+Cruise</li><li>Multi-copters</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) Manned Vehicle market consists of three main types: Tilt-X, Lift+Cruise, and Multi-copters. Tilt-X vehicles use tilting wings or rotors to transition from vertical to horizontal flight, combining the benefits of fixed-wing and rotorcraft aircraft. Lift+Cruise vehicles also have tilting capabilities but primarily rely on fixed-wing flight for longer distances. Multi-copters, on the other hand, use multiple rotors to achieve vertical lift and are typically used for short-distance travel. Each market type caters to different needs and applications in the eVTOL industry.</p></p>
