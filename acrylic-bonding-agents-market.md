<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Acrylic Bonding Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Re-Emulsifiable</li><li>Not Re-Emulsifiable</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Acrylic bonding agents are used in construction to improve the bonding between a new layer of concrete and existing surfaces. Re-emulsifiable acrylic bonding agents have the ability to re-emulsify when water is added, meaning they can be easily reactivated if the surface needs to be repaired or modified. On the other hand, not re-emulsifiable acrylic bonding agents cannot be reactivated with water once they have dried, providing a more permanent bond. Both types have their own advantages and are chosen based on the specific requirements of the construction project.</p></p>
