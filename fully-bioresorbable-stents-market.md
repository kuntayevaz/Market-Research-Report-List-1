<p><h1>Fully Bioresorbable Stents Market Analysis and Market Size: Global Industry Overview, Market Segmentation and Forecast (2023 to 2030)</h1></p><p><strong>Market Overview and Report Coverage</strong></p>
<p><p>Fully bioresorbable stents, also known as biodegradable stents, are medical devices used to treat cardiovascular diseases. Unlike traditional metal stents, which are permanent implants, these stents are made from materials that can be absorbed by the body over time. As the stent gradually dissolves, the artery's natural function is restored without the need for a permanent implant.</p><p>The future outlook for the fully bioresorbable stents market is highly promising. The market is driven by factors such as the increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, growing adoption of minimally invasive procedures, and advancements in stent technology. Moreover, the potential benefits of fully bioresorbable stents, such as reduced risk of late stent thrombosis and need for dual antiplatelet therapy, are further fueling market growth.</p><p>Additionally, the market is witnessing significant investments in research and development to improve the performance and safety of bioresorbable stents. Key players in the industry are focusing on developing stents with enhanced mechanical properties and incorporating drug-eluting capabilities to prevent restenosis. These advancements are expected to drive the demand for fully bioresorbable stents in the coming years.</p><p>However, there are some challenges that may impact the growth of the fully bioresorbable stents market. The high cost of these stents compared to traditional metallic stents and the lack of long-term clinical data on their efficacy and safety are some factors that may hinder market growth.</p><p>Despite these challenges, the fully bioresorbable stents market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 11.1% during the forecasted period. The increasing preference for minimally invasive procedures and the potential benefits offered by bioresorbable stents in terms of patient outcomes are expected to drive market growth. Moreover, ongoing technological advancements and research efforts aimed at improving the performance and safety of these stents will further propel market expansion.</p></p>
