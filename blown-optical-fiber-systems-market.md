<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Blown Optical Fiber Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydraulically Powered</li><li>Pneumatically Powered</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Blown optical fiber systems are used to install and distribute optical fibers in various settings. There are two types of blown optical fiber systems: hydraulically powered and pneumatically powered. </p><p>Hydraulically powered systems utilize hydraulic pressure to blow the fibers into the tubes. This method is beneficial for longer distances, as the hydraulic force can easily push the fibers through the ducts.</p><p>On the other hand, pneumatically powered systems use compressed air to propel the fibers. This method is more suitable for shorter distances or areas with obstructions, as the fibers are blown through the tubes with air pressure.</p></p>
