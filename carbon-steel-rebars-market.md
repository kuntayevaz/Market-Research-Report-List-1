<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Steel Rebars Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Deformed Steel</li><li>Mild Steel</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Carbon Steel Rebars market comprises different types of steel rebars, including Deformed Steel and Mild Steel. Deformed Steel rebars are manufactured with ribs or deformations on the surface, which provide extra strength and improved bonding with concrete. They are commonly used in reinforced concrete structures, such as bridges and buildings, due to their high tensile strength. On the other hand, Mild Steel rebars have a smooth surface and are less strong compared to Deformed Steel rebars. They are often used in small-scale construction projects and in areas with low seismic activity.</p></p>
