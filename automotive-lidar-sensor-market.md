<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Lidar Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solid State Lidar</li><li>Mechanical/Scanning Lidar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive lidar sensor market consists of two main types: solid-state lidar and mechanical/scanning lidar. Solid-state lidar uses an array of lasers and sensors to emit and measure light reflections, offering greater durability and reliability. It is smaller in size and suitable for integration into vehicles. In contrast, mechanical or scanning lidar systems use rotating mirrors or oscillating lasers to sweep the surroundings. While they provide a larger field of view, they are generally larger and more fragile than solid-state lidar.</p></p>
