<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tungsten CMP Slurry Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Selective Tungsten Slurries</li><li>Non-Selective Tungsten Slurries</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Tungsten CMP (Chemical-Mechanical Planarization) slurry is used in the semiconductor industry to polish and remove excess material from the surface of silicon wafers. There are two main types of Tungsten CMP slurries: selective and non-selective. Selective Tungsten slurries are designed to remove tungsten material preferentially, leaving other metals intact. On the other hand, non-selective Tungsten slurries remove all materials uniformly, including tungsten and other metals. The choice between these types depends on specific manufacturing requirements, such as the need for precise material removal or preserving other metals on the wafer's surface.</p></p>
