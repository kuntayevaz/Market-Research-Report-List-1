<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Composite Resins Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastic</li><li>Thermosetting</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Composite resins are a type of synthetic material commonly used in various industries. They can be classified into two main types: thermoplastic and thermosetting. Thermoplastic composite resins have the ability to soften and harden repeatedly through heating and cooling. They are highly flexible and can be reshaped easily. On the other hand, thermosetting composite resins harden irreversibly after being heated and molded, making them non-flexible and durable. Both types find applications in industries like automotive, aerospace, construction, and consumer goods, offering different properties and benefits depending on the specific requirements.</p></p>
