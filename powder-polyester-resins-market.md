<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Powder Polyester Resins Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydroxyl Terminated</li><li>Carboxyl Terminated</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Powder polyester resins are commonly used in various industries due to their excellent properties such as high strength and resistance to chemicals. There are two types of powder polyester resins: hydroxyl terminated and carboxyl terminated. Hydroxyl terminated resins contain hydroxyl groups that enable them to react with other chemical compounds, leading to the formation of a cross-linked network. Carboxyl terminated resins, on the other hand, have carboxyl groups that contribute to their adhesion properties and enhance their compatibility with other materials. These variations in chemical properties make them suitable for different applications.</p></p>
