<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Toroidal Inductor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fixed Inductance</li><li>Variable Inductance</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The toroidal inductor market can be categorized into two main types: fixed inductance and variable inductance. Fixed inductance toroidal inductors have a predetermined value of inductance, which remains constant regardless of external factors. They are commonly used in applications where a consistent inductance is required. On the other hand, variable inductance toroidal inductors allow for adjustable inductance values. This type is preferred in situations where flexibility is needed, as it allows the inductance to be modified according to the specific requirements of the circuit or system.</p></p>
