<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Brain Computer Interface (BCI) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive BCI</li><li>Non Invasive BCI</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Brain Computer Interface (BCI) market refers to technologies that allow direct communication between the human brain and a computer system. There are two main types of BCI markets: invasive and non-invasive. Invasive BCI involves the implantation of devices directly into the brain, enabling high-quality neural recording but requiring surgery. Non-invasive BCI, on the other hand, uses external sensors to detect brain activity, eliminating the need for surgery but potentially offering lower-quality data. Both markets aim to enable applications such as assistive technology, brain-controlled devices, and enhancing human-computer interaction.</p></p>
