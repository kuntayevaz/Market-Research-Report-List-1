<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ammonia-Fuelled Engine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spark-Ignition Engine</li><li>Compression-Ignition Engine</li><li>Gas-Turbine Engine</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The ammonia-fueled engine market consists of three main types: spark-ignition engines, compression-ignition engines, and gas-turbine engines. Spark-ignition engines use a spark to ignite a mixture of ammonia and air for combustion. Compression-ignition engines, on the other hand, compress the ammonia-air mixture until it self-ignites due to high pressure and temperature. Lastly, gas-turbine engines burn the ammonia fuel in a combustion chamber and use the resulting hot gases to power a turbine, generating mechanical energy. These different types offer various advantages and applications in the ammonia-fueled engine market.</p></p>
