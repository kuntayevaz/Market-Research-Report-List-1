<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) Sheet Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cast Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) Sheet</li><li>Extruded Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) Sheet</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) sheet is available in two market types: cast and extruded. Cast PMMA sheets are produced by pouring liquid plastic into a mold and allowing it to cool and solidify. These sheets have excellent optical clarity but are more expensive. On the other hand, extruded PMMA sheets are made by extruding molten plastic through rollers to form a continuous sheet. These sheets are less expensive and easier to produce, but may have slightly lower optical clarity compared to cast sheets.</p></p>
