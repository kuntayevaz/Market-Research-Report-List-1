<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spring Scales Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Scales</li><li>Digital Scales</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Spring Scales Market Types refer to two main categories: Mechanical Scales and Digital Scales. Mechanical scales utilize a spring mechanism to measure weight and are commonly found in old-fashioned weighing machines. These scales are operated manually and do not require electricity. On the other hand, digital scales use electronic sensors to provide weight measurements. They are more accurate and often come with additional features like body fat analysis. Digital scales require batteries or electric power to function. Both types serve the purpose of measuring weight but differ in their mechanisms and functionalities.</p></p>
