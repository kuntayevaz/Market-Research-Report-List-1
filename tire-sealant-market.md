<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tire Sealant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Latex-based Sealant</li><li>Latex-free Sealants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Tire sealant is categorized into two main types: latex-based and latex-free sealants. Latex-based sealants rely on a liquid polymer called latex, which forms a protective layer within the tire when it comes into contact with air. These sealants are effective at sealing small punctures and leaks. On the other hand, latex-free sealants work without using latex and usually consist of a blend of fibers, binders, and other polymers that create a similar sealing effect. Both types of sealants help prevent air leaks and maintain tire pressure for longer periods.</p></p>
