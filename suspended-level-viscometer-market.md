<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Suspended-Level Viscometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Calibrated</li><li>Uncalibrated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the suspended-level viscometer market, there are two main types: calibrated and uncalibrated. Calibrated viscometers are devices that have been precisely adjusted and verified to measure viscosity accurately. They undergo a calibration process to ensure their readings are reliable and consistent. On the other hand, uncalibrated viscometers have not been subjected to this calibration procedure, meaning their accuracy may vary and cannot be guaranteed. Calibrated viscometers are usually preferred in industries where precise viscosity measurements are crucial, while uncalibrated ones may find use in less critical applications.</p></p>
