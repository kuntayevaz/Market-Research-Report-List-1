<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PET/CT Scanner Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Digital PET/CT</li><li>Analog PET/CT</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The PET/CT scanner market consists of two main types: Digital PET/CT and Analog PET/CT. Digital PET/CT scanners use detectors that directly convert the gamma photons into digital signals, resulting in improved image quality and reduced scan times. They also allow for quantitative analysis of radiotracer concentration. On the other hand, Analog PET/CT scanners use detectors that convert the gamma photons into electrical signals, and then these signals are readout and processed. Although analog scanners are cheaper, they provide lower image quality and lack quantitative capabilities compared to digital scanners.</p></p>
