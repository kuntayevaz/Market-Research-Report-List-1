<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bio-absorbable Bone Screw Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fully Threaded Screws</li><li>Partially Threaded Screws</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bio-absorbable bone screws are medical devices used in orthopedic surgeries for holding bones together during the healing process. Fully threaded screws are designed with threads along their entire length, providing maximum stability and compression. They are commonly used in dense bone structures. Partially threaded screws have only a portion of their length threaded, allowing for flexibility and reduced interference with the bone. They are often used in softer bone structures or areas requiring less compression. Both types of screws offer advantages depending on the specific surgical requirements and bone characteristics.</p></p>
